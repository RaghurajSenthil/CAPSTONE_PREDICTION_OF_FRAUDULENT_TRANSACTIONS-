# CAPSTONE_PREDICTION_OF_FRAUDULENT_TRANSACTIONS-

The fraudulent transaction is a wide-ranging issue for financial institutions, 
involving theft and fraud committed using a payment gateway. 
In this report, we explore the application of machine learning models on real fraudulent transaction data. 
The models built are supervised fraud models that attempt to identify which 
transactions are most likely fraudulent. 
Here I have done two different types of iteration. 
In the first iteration, we discuss the processes of data exploration, data 
cleaning, checking outliers, balancing data, model algorithms, and results. Three 
different supervised models are explored and compared including logistic 
regression, random forest, decision tree, and GridSearchCV. 
The GridSearchCV model shows the best accuracy for logistic regression, which is known as the 
Hyperparameter tuning model. 
In the second iteration, I used MYSQL workbench to export the dataset and used POWERBI for visualization of the given dataset.
A similar model development process can be performed in related business domains 
such as insurance and banking sectors, to avoid or detect fraudulent activity.
